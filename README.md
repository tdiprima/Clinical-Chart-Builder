# 🏥 Clinical Chart Builder

The **Clinical Chart Builder** is a Python-based web app that lets users generate interactive charts from OMOP CDM-formatted clinical data using natural language. It uses GPT-4o (via Azure OpenAI) to interpret user prompts and generate Python/Plotly code to create relevant visualizations.

This is built to prototype AI-assisted charting for clinical data teams using the OMOP CDM (Common Data Model).
